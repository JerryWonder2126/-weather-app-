# Weather App
## Description
This project is basically a web app that displays the weather conditions of the user's location. Users can also search for the weather condition of a different location by name. All of these is made possible via integration of the OpenWeatherMap API. Also, the user's location is access via the GeoLocation  (accessible on the browser).

The workflow looks like this

The search workflow as looks closely like that. A live URL will be shared soon.

## How to run this project
This project can be viewed on .... but if you want to run it locally, you can do so by following these steps.
- Clone the repo.
- Run yarn install or npm install (You may have to delete the yarn.lock file to avoid conflicts if you opt in for npm)
- Create an account with OpenWeatherMap API and generate an access key
- Set an environment variable with variable name of OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY, assign your access key to this. Also create another variable PORT to specify the port on which the localhost will run. Since you're running this locally, you can set this up easily with ``dotenv``.
- Run yarn run dev (or npm run dev) to start the development server.
### Extras
The start script in the package.json file is meant for use in production but you can still use it locally. Before using it, you should run the build script first, this transpiles the typescript files to javascript. Without this, the start script will fail, as it is setup to start the server from the transpiled javascript files.
